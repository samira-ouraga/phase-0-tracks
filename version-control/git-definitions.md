# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
version control is a system that recordes changes made to file over time. It is useful because it helps recalling specific versions later. In group project, it other see who modified a part and what they did. If there is a mistake, one can go back to previous working versions. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is another directory where I can copy a code and modify it.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit adds the changes made to a repository. It makes it part of the head repository. A good commit message is very specific. 

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when two people make different changes to the same line in the same file. Git would not know which is correct and the merge conflict will happen.
