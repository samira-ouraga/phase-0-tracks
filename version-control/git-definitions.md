# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
version control is a system that recordes changes made to file over time. It is useful because it helps recalling specific versions later. In group project, it other see who modified a part and what they did. If there is a mistake, one can go back to previous working versions.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is another directory where I can copy a code and modify it.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit adds the changes made to a repository. It makes it part of the head repository. A good commit message is very specific.

* What is a merge conflict?
 A merge conflict occurs when two people make different changes to the same line in the same file. Git would not know which is correct and the merge conflict will happen. Please prevent merge conflict at all times!
